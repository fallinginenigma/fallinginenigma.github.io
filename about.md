I relate to this quote by Seneca more often than others.

On a regular day: I work in Logistics dealing with Transporters, Senior Management and my Digital Transformation project where I manage fleet tracking for Grasim’s Indian Plants. At home I spend my time learning how to play the guitar, building / writing code / learning code for building ideas I have.

What gives me immense pleasure? To crush my enemies, to see them driven before me, and to hear the lamentations of their women. [^2]

Just kidding. I like to relax while watching anime, sit-coms (i like laughing) and building things. I like solving puzzles and problems, talking about ideas, the stars and art. And I want to write about these on `Move 37`, my Blog. 

I also like reading:
- wisdom from kind people on the internet
- weird facts like these: Peeling a Post-It® from the [side](https://tylercipriani.com/blog/2022/05/28/on-the-proper-use-of-post-its/) - and it won't curl up when stuck on surfaces.
- And books
