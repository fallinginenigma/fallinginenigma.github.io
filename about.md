I relate to this quote by Seneca more often than others.

On a regular day: I work in Logistics dealing with Transporters, Senior Management and my Digital Transformation project where I manage fleet tracking for Grasim’s Indian Plants. At home I spend my time learning how to play the guitar, building / writing code / learning code for building ideas I have. 

>An interactive graph of what I do on a regular day: read, sleep, eat, work (deal with transporters, dispatch, GPS), and play games on the PS5.

What gives me immense pleasure? To crush my enemies, to see them driven before me, and to hear the lamentations of their women. [^2]

Just kidding. I like to relax while watching anime, sit-coms (i like laughing) and building things. I like solving puzzles and problems, talking about ideas, the stars and art. And I want to write about these on `Move 37`, my Blog. 

I also like reading:
- wisdom from kind people on the internet
- weird facts like these: Peeling a Post-It® from the [side](https://tylercipriani.com/blog/2022/05/28/on-the-proper-use-of-post-its/) - and it won't curl up when stuck on surfaces.
- And books
