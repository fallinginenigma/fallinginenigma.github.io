In 2021, I was exploring [MIT&#39;s Missing Semester:](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) a great series of lectures on different computer tools. I recommend this to anyone who wants to have a basic level of understanding about terminal and the modern tech stack.

It has a lecture on seeting up you own [Dotfiles](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2019/dotfiles/). Dotlines are way to configure software that you generally use and this personalisation would help you be faster and more productive with your workflow. Here is notes on how to set up my dotfiles:

## Commands to set up Dotfiles

```
git clone https://github.com/fallinginenigma/dotfiles.git --recursive

cd dotfiles && ./install
```

## Merge Git to GitHub

```
git add .

git commit -m 'add some message'

git push origin main 
```

## Errors I ran into:

- Adding submodules in .gitmodules
  - Adding Vim plugins
  - Adding zsh plugins
- Mis-spelling Solarized as Solarised with an 's' instead of a 'z'
- Configuring the YAML file
  - Adding appropriate whitespace characters
  - Adding force: true to force symbolic link
  - Adding the command ``[git submodule update --init --recursive, Installing/updating submodules]``
  - Running the same command in '~/dotfiles' to see if there is something wrong
