Hi Everyone!

The blog is called [Move37](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/sadness-beauty-watching-googles-ai-play-go/),  named after the move that Lee Sodol, a Go Champion didnâ€™t anticipate in the series of Go matches he played against AlphaGo, an AI that defeated him winning 3 out of 5 matches. The name is an ode to the beauty of mathematics, computer science, and algorithms.Here is a wonderful documentary about the entire tournament: [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y)

I decided to build a site for 3 reasons in 2021:

1. I wanted to set-up a site to have all my notes, I jumped into a rabbit hole after reading [castel.dev](castel.dev)'s article about notes in LaTeX.
2. To show and tell others about the ideas I have about anything that strikes my fancy. This is my digital garden. [^1]
3. I was trying to solve a problem: During my first learning weekend at ISB, I had to tell my peers where I am from and what I do - neither NRTI nor Grasim were popular.

As of July 2025, both reasons 1 and 3 are now redudant and now I have a small space of the internet to myself!
