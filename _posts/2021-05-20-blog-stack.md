I decided to build a site for 3 reasons:

- I wanted to set-up a site to have all my notes, I jumped into a rabbit hole after reading [castel.dev](castel.dev)'s article about notes in LaTeX.
- To show and tell others about the ideas I have about Astronomy, Computer Science, Technology, Quantum Physics, Anime, Pokémon, Manga and anything that strikes my fancy. This is my digital garden. [^1]
- I was trying to solve a problem, my first learning weekend at ISB, I had to tell my peers where I am from and what I do - neither NRTI nor Grasim were popular.

Feynman shows us by example that it is acceptable to explore a diversity of fields if that is where your curiosity leads. [^2]

The blog is called [Move37](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/sadness-beauty-watching-googles-ai-play-go/),  named after the move that Lee Sodol, Go Champion didn’t anticipate in the series of Go matches he played against AlphaGo, an AI that defeats him winning 3 out of 5 matches. The name is an ode to the beauty of mathematics, computer science and algorithms.Here is a wonderful documentary about the entire tournament: [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y)

The site was built using Jekyll and [Henry](https://github.com/kaushikgopal/henry-jekyll) by Kaushik Gopal. Found this theme on reddit and his ideology and the implementation of features such as side notes and [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/). I used GitHub Pages to host and Jekyll as the Static Site Generator to build `Move 37`. With little proficiency in CSS, Javascript, Ruby, and HTML, I use the help of some kind friends, reddit, lot of documentation on Github Pages, and Cursor. I started using Cursor in 2025, using AI to build features and correct the layouts.

Since I wanted the blog to a light and minimal theme after looking at Castel's Blog, after some searching I found Solarised theme [here](https://gist.github.com/nicolashery/5765395). A blog on why you should [Join The (solarized) Light Side!](http://www.stevenzc.com/2016/03/14/join-the-light-side.html)

I want to thank my friends: Satvik Ambati and Vivek Amirisetty for helping me figure many things and being patient when I was learning and fixing things over midnight Discord calls.
