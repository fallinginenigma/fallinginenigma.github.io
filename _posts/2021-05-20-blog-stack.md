Welcome to Jekyll and Henry!

[Henry](https://github.com/kaushikgopal/henry-jekyll) and [Henry's features](https://blog.jkl.gg/henry-jekyll-theme/) - A Jekyll Theme by Kaushik Gopal. 
Found this theme on reddit and his ideology and the implementation of features such as side notes and [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/)

I used GitHub Pages to host and Jekyll as the Static Site Generator to build `Move 37`. Unknowningly, I also used a lot of CSS, Javascript and Ruby.

Since I wanted the blog to a light and minimal theme after looking at Castel's Blog, after some searching I found Solarised theme [here](https://gist.github.com/nicolashery/5765395). 
A blog on why you should [Join The (solarized) Light Side!](http://www.stevenzc.com/2016/03/14/join-the-light-side.html)

I want to thank my friends: Satvik Ambati and Vivek Amirisetty for helping me figure many things and being patient when I was learning and fixing things over midnight Discord calls.
