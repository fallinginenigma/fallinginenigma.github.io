# To Do
- [ ] 404 Page in _layouts
- [ ] Add posts on Pokemon Emerald, how to build a Lily 58, etc
- [ ] https://github.com/jwilber/roughViz
- [ ] Add Last Modified functionality (It breaks when you add it to the gemspec or the config.yml) [^1]
- [ ] A post with https://github.com/SimplGy/jekyll-timeline
- [ ] Bi-directional links to the blog: https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/tree/master/_plugins
- [ ] Automatic site map being generated and represented as a tree map - every time a new post is created. - Either on the website or on github: https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template/tree/master/_plugins
- [ ] Justified alignment on all posts.
- [ ] Crosscheck the readability of the site using this: https://learnui.design/tools/typography-tutorial.html
- [ ] For ISB Specific Weekends - My contact info - need to have a fallback page that is only active during the weekends. Maybe have a branch that is activated or merged during that time. 
- [ ] Can we have multiple branches on github? Which will lead to having multiple versions of the website.
- [ ] Can we insert an interactive graph in a markdown webpage? D3 is the answer to that.

## Future Plans:
- [ ] Theme Switcher: Light vs. Dark mode
