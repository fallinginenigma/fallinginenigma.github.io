I have spent way too much time working on this website than actually write something. It is time to stop consuming and start creating.

I will be starting my MBA at ISB, Hyderabad, soon. I plan on writing about my experiences during the MBA (it is a personal blog, isn't it?). 
Last night, I had an idea on how I can hone my problem solving skills: I would work on approaches and solutions to problems that businesses were facing and try to build picture of how my solutions would affect the problem.

I also had some cool ideas, I was working on, I probably might update all the previous articles and add a few others.

My plan for this year is to take these words from Dagny in Atlas Shrugged seriously: _"I've hired you to do a job, not to do your best â€“ whatever that is."_

**Happy 2023!** It might be late but better than never, I guess.
