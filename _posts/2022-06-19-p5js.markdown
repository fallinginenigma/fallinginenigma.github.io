Sites that have been used to integrate p5js on the page:
- [Blue Squares - Happy Coding](https://happycoding.io/examples/p5js/calling-functions/blue-squares)
- [Simple p5 sketch by Benjamin Habert](https://benjaminhabert.github.io/jekyll-p5-portfolio/projects/simple_sketch/p5project.html)
    - [p5 Portfolio](https://github.com/BenjaminHabert/jekyll-p5-portfolio)

Then, I implemented a widget.
Setting up p5js widgets: [guide to the setup](https://toolness.github.io/p5.js-widget/)

<script type="text/p5" src="/assets/posts/p5js/1.html"></script>

<div id="simple-sketch-holder">
<script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/posts/p5js/1.js"></script>
</div>

In order to include a P5.js sketch in the post:

- Import the p5.js library as a dependency. You can complete the front-matter of the post like this:

{%highlight yaml %}
---
dependencies:
    - p5
---
{%endhighlight%}

- create in `div` in the markdown document of your post and include the javascript file
(relative path from the markdown document). Note that we gave the `div` a custom id.

{%highlight html %}
<div id="simple-sketch-holder">
    <script type="text/javascript" src="simple_sketch.js"></script>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

- in your javascript file, make sure to link the canvas to this specific `div`. See the
[documentation](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Positioning-your-canvas)
for more information.

{% highlight javascript %}
function setup() {
  canvas = createCanvas(710, 400);
  canvas.parent('simple-sketch-holder'); 
  // this ensures that the sketch will be positioned properly
}
{% endhighlight %}

**Note**: using the method, you can only include a single sketch per file. See [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Global-and-instance-mode) if you
want to have several sketches running simultaneously.
