This page contains a list of the technologies I use, both software and hardware. I’ve seen a number of other people doing a "uses" page and I’ve always found them interesting, so here’s mine:

## Hardware
- Acer Nitro 5 (i5 8th gen, 2018)
    - RAM: 12 GB
    - Storage: 256 GB SSD, 1 TB HDD
    - OS: Windows 11 and Fedora 36 (dual boot)

- Gigabyte 34" 2K Monitor

- iPhone 13 (2021)
    - Storage: 128 GB
    - OS: iOS 16

- iPad Air (2022)
    - Storage: 64 GB
    - OS: iPad OS 16

## Software

All software I run on Windows 11 + WSL2 with Ubuntu:

- VS Code
- Chrome (it was speed vs resource utilization - I chose speed)
- Discord
- Adobe Photoshop
- VLC
