This page contains a list of the technologies I use, both software and hardware. I’ve seen a number of other people doing a "uses" page and I’ve always found them interesting, so here’s mine:

## Hardware
- MacBook Pro [M1 Pro]
- Gigabyte 34" 2K Monitor
- iPhone 16 Pro
- iPad Air (2022)

## Software

All software I run on my Mac:

- VS Code
- Chrome (it was speed vs resource utilization - I chose speed)
- Discord
- Adobe Photoshop
- VLC
