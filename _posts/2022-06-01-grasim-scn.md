I briefly worked at Grasim Industries Limited, an Aditya Birla Group (ABG) flagship company. It partly owns UltraTech cement and Aditya Birla Capital. You might not have heard Grasim if you were born after the 2000s. It is a B2B brand called Birla Cellulose that manufactures Viscose Rayon Fibre (VSF), a man-made fibre similar to cotton.

It is ABG's oldest company, more than 75 years old and how the Birlas built their empire and fortune from a small town called Nagda in Madhya Pradesh, India. Mostly caters to spinners that weave yarn and other textile companies that are clustered in Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu. I work in Grasim's and the world's largest Man-Made Cellulose Fibre (MMCF) Manufacturing Plant at Vilayat, Bharuch, Gujarat.

Grasim is the first entity in the Value Chain. It provides Raw Material, manufacturing it directly from the trees. It harvests trees for pulp and uses pulp to manufacture VSF. Grasim also manufactures the chemicals: Caustic Soda, Carbon Disulphide, Sulphuric Acid, it requires from the sister concern: Grasim Chemicals.

It imports coal and pulp, manufactures chemicals and VSF.
