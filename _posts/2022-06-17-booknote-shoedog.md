My first basketball shoes were a pair of Nikes and they were the best pair of shoes I ever owned. I loved the product, it was not cheap and I did not understand why they were so expensive then. Naturally, I was curious about why they sold shoes and happened to pick up the founder's memoir: Shoe Dog. I enjoyed reading every page of it, I could feel the pure joy of a man who decided to sell what he believes in: running.

Half way into the book, I wanted to look at the shoes that Phil and his colleagues at Blue Ribbon designed. So, I collected all the pictures of it:

"Donâ€™t tell people how to do things, tell them what to do and let them surprise you with their results."

Pictures of every shoe by Onitsuka:
