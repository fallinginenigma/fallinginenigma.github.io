National Rail and Transportation Institute - [NRTI](gsv.ac.in) *( it is now called Gati Shakti Viswavidyalaya)*

Set-up on the vision of then Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, it is India's first Transportation university.

As a part of my undergraduate degree, I have learned about enough types of thinking, added managerial tools and mindset to my skill set, and was overenthusiastic about bringing a change to the way things work.

Here is a list of courses I have taken here over a course of 1000 days:
