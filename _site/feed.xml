It is time to stop consuming and start creating.</p>

<p>I will be starting my MBA at ISB, Hyderabad, soon. I plan on writing about my experiences during the MBA (it is a personal blog, isn’t it?). 
Last night, I had an idea on how I can hone my problem solving skills: I would work on approaches and solutions to problems that businesses were facing and try to build picture of how my solutions would affect the problem.</p>

<p>I also had some cool ideas, I was working on, I probably might update all the previous articles and add a few others.</p>

<p>My plan for this year is to take these words from Dagny in Atlas Shrugged seriously: <em>“I’ve hired you to do a job, not to do your best – whatever that is.”</em></p>

<p><strong>Happy 2023!</strong> It might be late but better than never, I guess.</p>]]></content><author><name>Karthik Perla</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have spent way too much time working on this website than actually write something.

<p>Then, I implemented a widget.
Setting up p5js widgets: <a href="https://toolness.github.io/p5.js-widget/">guide to the setup</a></p>

<script type="text/p5" src="/assets/posts/p5js/1.html"></script>

<div id="simple-sketch-holder">
<script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/posts/p5js/1.js"></script>
</div>

<p>In order to include a P5.js sketch in the post:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Import the p5.js library as a dependency. You can complete the front-matter of the post like this:</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="nn">---</span>
<span class="na">dependencies</span><span class="pi">:</span>
    <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">p5</span>
<span class="nn">---</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>create in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> in the markdown document of your post and include the javascript file
(relative path from the markdown document). Note that we gave the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code> a custom id.</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">"simple-sketch-holder"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

<span class="nt">&lt;/div&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>in your javascript file, make sure to link the canvas to this specific <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">div</code>. See the
<a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Positioning-your-canvas">documentation</a>
for more information.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: using the method, you can only include a single sketch per file. See <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Global-and-instance-mode">here</a> if you
want to have several sketches running simultaneously.</p>]]></content><author><name>Karthik Perla</name></author><category term="meta" /><category term="meta" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sites that have been used to integrate p5js on the page: Blue Squares - Happy Coding Simple p5 sketch by Benjamin Habert p5 Portfolio]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Book notes - Shoe Dog</title><link href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/nike/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Book notes - Shoe Dog" /><published>2022-06-17T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2022-06-17T00:00:00+05:30</updated><id>http://0.0.0.0:4000/booknote-shoedog</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://0.0.0.0:4000/nike/"><![CDATA[<p>My first basketball shoes were a pair of Nikes and they were the best pair of shoes I ever owned.

<ul>
  <li>The common wisdom was, “If you have a chicken and egg problem — buy the chicken.”</li>
  <li>Flintstoning across industries and you’ll see the focus tends to be on replicating the hard side of the network with employees, contractors, and other direct efforts.</li>
  <li>Eventually, the workflow is automated so that the marketplace becomes more of a tech company, but the first few years are just people powered. - <em>*Fleetx.io does this.</em></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Nintendo, Xbox, Sony - all set-up a few games, in a way, flintstoning, to gear up the product launch. Launch exclusive games built within the company, build a network - then let third party players jump on to the network.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>“Product can solve problems, but it’s slow. Ops can do it fast.”</strong> As a result, Uber saw itself as an “ops-led” company, and it was this team that best embodied the startup’s entrepreneurial and creative culture.</li>
  <li>Only three sourcing strategies account for every B2B company’s very early growth. These are:
    <ul>
      <li>Personal network,</li>
      <li>Seek out customers where they are,</li>
      <li>Get press.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Thus, your choices are easy, yet limited. Almost every B2B business both hits up their personal network and heads to the places their potential customers were spending time. The question isn’t which of these two routes to pursue, but instead how far your own network will take you before you move on.</p>
  </li>
  <li>One of the most common types of advice we give at Y Combinator is to <em>do things that don’t scale.</em></li>
  <li>The most common unscalable thing founders have to do at the start is to recruit users manually. Nearly all startups have to. You can’t wait for users to come to you. You have to go out and get them. There are two reasons founders resist going out and recruiting users individually:
    <ul>
      <li>One is a combination of shyness and laziness. They’d rather sit at home writing code than go out and talk to a bunch of strangers and probably be rejected by most of them.</li>
      <li>But for a startup to succeed, at least one founder (usually the CEO) will have to spend a lot of time on sales and marketing.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>By building the functionality that the initial set of customers need on an ad hoc basis, and then generalising, start-ups have a better chance to hit product/market fit.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consumers will find unexpected use cases for your product/service - sometimes, might pull it into a grey area.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>There are a trio of network effects:
    <ul>
      <li>Engagement</li>
      <li>Acquisition</li>
      <li>Economics.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Engagement Effects:  This process can be modelled as an “engagement loop” that describes how users derive value from others in a network in a step-by step process.</li>
  <li>From the user perspective, think about how these engagement loops are often best visualised, step by step, as a series of actions that tie into each other. Improving any step in the loop benefits all downstream actions</li>
  <li>create user cohorts by levels of engagement, and analyse what differentiates high value users from lower value ones. These start out as correlations, so use A/B testing to prove causality—once the best levers are found, test many variations of these ideas.</li>
  <li>As a rough benchmark for evaluating startups at Andreessen Horowitz, I often look for a minimum baseline of 60 percent retention after day 1, 30 percent after day 7, and 15 percent at day 30, where the curve eventually levels out.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Often, it is the power users that know how well the product or the service works - not just because of the time they have spent using the product but also because the growth team targets and nudges the user with features that will make this user stay on the product longer.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Driver Rewards @ Uber : Do X trips and get $Y — called <strong>DxGy</strong> at Uber</li>
  <li>It may be easy to copy features, but it’s nearly impossible to copy a network.</li>
  <li>Once Saturation hits, to add more revenue - add layers to the cake (add adjacent networks by targeting other markets adjacent to the core market) and for the core market - add new formats to engage.</li>
  <li>“Yet <strong>hitting the ceiling is an inevitable outcome of success,</strong> and companies need a response, lest they slow down to a crawl.”</li>
  <li>Over time, the effect of marketing strategies - die down. The Law of Shitty Clickthroughs is best countered through improving network effects, not by spending more on marketing.</li>
  <li>Rarely in network-effects-driven categories does a product win based on features—instead, it’s a combination of harnessing network effects and building a product experience that reinforces those advantages.</li>
  <li>Cherry picking is an enormously powerful move because it exposes the fundamental asymmetry between the David and Goliath dynamic of networks.</li>
  <li>Competitive Intelligence: When a networked product takes competition seriously, it has to collect metrics to figure out the comparative position of all the players in the market.</li>
  <li>The distribution advantages don’t win when the product is inferior. (In case of Microsoft Bing and Explorer)</li>

<p>My first song by EDEN (Jonathan Ng / Jon) was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6K6OCvFQ4i7KKfGJsOAqY1?si=728e5803cd4445a9">Wake Up</a> posted by Suicide Sheep on YouTube. As a teen I was very excited about studying in America and the lyrics deeply resonated with me. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Then, a few months went by without a lot of exploration and Wake Up was one of my songs on repeat. I dabbled a little in <em>i think you think too much of me</em> and <em>End Credits.</em> I was then unaware that Jon was also behind The Eden Project.</p>

<p>Things really changed after the Vertigo album was released, and it changed my life. I noticed how the artist is keen on details such as the audience voices in love; not brave from vertigo, the female voice in crash - is actually him. I am obsessed with the idea of falling, <em>falling in reverse</em> really hit me. I enjoy glass smashing samples in music and I love the way he incorporates it into his music and storytelling. The song also inspired me to make this piece of digital art.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>insert falling in reverse artwork</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of my art is inspired from the ideas I have had while jamming to his music.</p>

<p>As someone really crazy about even the minute details (careful, the devil is in them) I appreciated the fact that EDEN really planned out everything in his music. I then dived into this entire world to imagine and experience the effort put into producing music. As I grew up, I understood the deep meaning and his melancholic expression of the mundane things in life. He is also very sneaky, sometimes goes uncredited in songs such as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0USkfjn6fgZ52cEi1gWMKp?si=60c72a9d9b204adb">Follow by ZES</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3X0J4QzAMCoyMZUSMCoVDw?si=0a817cd011674a91">thinking 2 much by Jeremy Zucker</a>.</p>

<p>As time passes, you start appreciating the artist for more than his work. I admire the style, graphic design and his yearly videos. I spend my new year’s eve refreshing the Youtube feed to check if he has released a new video. It is in the vertigo world tour video - I first heard the synth samples for rushing from no future. The song gives me immense pleasure and makes me feel at peace.</p>

<p>The album art for End Credits: <a href="http://www.jamessaulsky.com/the-viewfinder-project">Project Viewfinder</a>. Then, the entire no future project with blocks of squares across the project.</p>

<p>I am thankful that the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eden/">r/eden</a> subreddit exists and I get to catch the glimpses of the tours around the world. The community is also very lovely and wonderful - they know what brings all of us together. It is unfortunate that EDEN doesn’t tour in Asia (I don’t blame him) and I absolutely love this image from his London vertigo tour.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>insert vertigo tour, give credits to the user on reddit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His music taste and inspirations from Frank Ocean  and Yung Lean are evident in his music as well as his Spotify playlists. In a way, it is EDEN that got me into Frank Ocean and Yung Lean - as well as started appreciating other Indie artists such as Jeremy Zucker and Chelsea Cutler. I have made this shift from bass-heavy EDM to an Indie Pop genre - something very similar to the shift in genre by Jon in his music production.</p>

<p>It is these little things and the details in the way EDEN explores the world with his music is exactly the reason I love his work. Thank you Jon, for making the time go a little easier.</p>

As <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber</a> writes on the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown site</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The overriding design goal for Markdown’s
formatting syntax is to make it as readable
as possible. The idea is that a
Markdown-formatted document should be
publishable as-is, as plain text, without
looking like it’s been marked up with tags <sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>
or formatting instructions.</p>

<h2 id="docker">Docker</h2>

<p>Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.</p>

<p>By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the
Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to
build the image. <sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">cd </span>dillinger
docker build <span class="nt">-t</span> &lt;youruser&gt;/dillinger:<span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">package</span><span class="p">.json.version</span><span class="k">}</span> <span class="nb">.</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies.
Be sure to swap out <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${package.json.version}</code> with the actual
version of Dillinger.</p>

<p>Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on
your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to
port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker run <span class="nt">-d</span> <span class="nt">-p</span> 8000:8080 <span class="nt">--restart</span><span class="o">=</span>always <span class="nt">--cap-add</span><span class="o">=</span>SYS_ADMIN <span class="nt">--name</span><span class="o">=</span>dillinger &lt;youruser&gt;/dillinger:<span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">package</span><span class="p">.json.version</span><span class="k">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--capt-add=SYS-ADMIN</code> is required for PDF rendering.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in
your preferred browser.</p>
