    <article class="post-content">

        <p>I admire this Indie artist from Ireland, a lot.</p>

<p>My first song by EDEN (Jonathan Ng / Jon) was <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/6K6OCvFQ4i7KKfGJsOAqY1?si=728e5803cd4445a9">Wake Up</a> posted by Suicide Sheep on YouTube. As a teen I was very excited about studying in America and the lyrics deeply resonated with me. <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Then, a few months went by without a lot of exploration and Wake Up was one of my songs on repeat. I dabbled a little in <em>i think you think too much of me</em> and <em>End Credits.</em> I was then unaware that Jon was also behind The Eden Project.</p>

<p>Things really changed after the Vertigo album was released, and it changed my life. I noticed how the artist is keen on details such as the audience voices in love; not brave from vertigo, the female voice in crash - is actually him. I am obsessed with the idea of falling, <em>falling in reverse</em> really hit me. I enjoy glass smashing samples in music and I love the way he incorporates it into his music and storytelling. The song also inspired me to make this piece of digital art.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>insert falling in reverse artwork</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Most of my art is inspired from the ideas I have had while jamming to his music.</p>

<p>As someone really crazy about even the minute details (careful, the devil is in them) I appreciated the fact that EDEN really planned out everything in his music. I then dived into this entire world to imagine and experience the effort put into producing music. As I grew up, I understood the deep meaning and his melancholic expression of the mundane things in life. He is also very sneaky, sometimes goes uncredited in songs such as <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0USkfjn6fgZ52cEi1gWMKp?si=60c72a9d9b204adb">Follow by ZES</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3X0J4QzAMCoyMZUSMCoVDw?si=0a817cd011674a91">thinking 2 much by Jeremy Zucker</a>.</p>

<p>As time passes, you start appreciating the artist for more than his work. I admire the style, graphic design and his yearly videos. I spend my new year’s eve refreshing the Youtube feed to check if he has released a new video. It is in the vertigo world tour video - I first heard the synth samples for rushing from no future. The song gives me immense pleasure and makes me feel at peace.</p>

<p>The album art for End Credits: <a href="http://www.jamessaulsky.com/the-viewfinder-project">Project Viewfinder</a>. Then, the entire no future project with blocks of squares across the project.</p>

<p>I am thankful that the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/eden/">r/eden</a> subreddit exists and I get to catch the glimpses of the tours around the world. The community is also very lovely and wonderful - they know what brings all of us together. It is unfortunate that EDEN doesn’t tour in Asia (I don’t blame him) and I absolutely love this image from his London vertigo tour.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>insert vertigo tour, give credits to the user on reddit</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His music taste and inspirations from Frank Ocean  and Yung Lean are evident in his music as well as his Spotify playlists. In a way, it is EDEN that got me into Frank Ocean and Yung Lean - as well as started appreciating other Indie artists such as Jeremy Zucker and Chelsea Cutler. I have made this shift from bass-heavy EDM to an Indie Pop genre - something very similar to the shift in genre by Jon in his music production.</p>

<p>It is these little things and the details in the way EDEN explores the world with his music is exactly the reason I love his work. Thank you Jon, for making the time go a little easier.</p>
