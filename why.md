**This is for Blueberry Muffin. You inspire me to be myself.**

For the last few years, I devoted most of my attention and energy towards a goal. The goal fell through and lately has become a hindrance. Therefore, I have decided to work redirecting all that energy into something creative.

I decided to build a site for 3 reasons:

- I wanted to set-up a site to have all my notes, I jumped into a rabbit hole after reading [castel.dev](castel.dev)'s article about notes in LaTeX.
- To show and tell others about the ideas I have about Astronomy, Computer Science, Technology, Quantum Physics, Anime, Pokémon, Manga and anything that strikes my fancy. This is my digital garden. [^1]
- I was trying to solve a problem, my first learning weekend at ISB, I had to tell my peers where I am from and what I do - neither NRTI nor Grasim were popular.

Feynman shows us by example that it is acceptable to explore a diversity of fields if that is where your curiosity leads. [^2]

The blog is called [Move37](https://www.wired.com/2016/03/sadness-beauty-watching-googles-ai-play-go/),  named after the move that Lee Sodol, Go Champion didn’t anticipate in the series of Go matches he played against AlphaGo, an AI that defeats him winning 3 out of 5 matches. The name is an ode to the beauty of mathematics, computer science and algorithms.

Here is a wonderful documentary about the entire tournament: [AlphaGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXuK6gekU1Y)

You might find that posts on this site have changed since you’ve last read a post. I wanted to follow the paradigm – Write, Revise, Edit. In short, every post will go through an iterative process until I deem it perfect.

Since it is iterative, the revision history would be archived for readers to refer back to it.
